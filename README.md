# Common Cause
An Android app to make volunteer, staff and resource tracking easy and accessible.
## Introduction
A couple years ago, while working as a volunteer coordinator in event management, I decided to write an app to help me track all the hours committed by volunteers at events and their information to make sure everyone is accurately recognized for their dedication and support. 

The app was basic but got the job done and made tracking the hundreds of volunteers at events a lot easier. It featured a kiosk mode (inspired by self-checkout machines at stores) to allow volunteers to sign in and out of their shifts and confirm their information, freeing up the volunteer coordinator to focus on training and building meaningful connections with volunteers. The app used Firebase to allow for cross device syncing between phones and company tablets and worked even at events where internet connection did not exist. The app also performed basic tracking of resource consumption at these events.

As this was one of the first real app projects I had worked on, I had a lot of learning to do and the code was inconsistent and cluttered. Over time, this made implementing new features difficult and time consuming. I eventually decided to rewrite the entire app to make it more general to more organizations and use cases, with a focus on increasing usability and overall code quality.

This is what this project aims to do. By rewriting the app, I hope to simplify the management and tracking of volunteer and staff hours and resources while remaining customizable to the needs of each organization. Features I hope to improve upon over the previous app and implement include digital contract/waiver management, ID card support, analytic tool for monitoring turnout and performance and lots more.

**Unfortunately, I am not actively developing this app due to time constraints with school, however I would like to resume development when I have time. ðŸ¤ž**
